Version 1.0.1

	Fixes dimension problems due to rounding errors.

	New option added to MOSFETs. Now you are able to choose whether you want to calculate the device's width based on finger width, or vice versa.
	If you choose the option to calculate the "finger_width", parameter "wf" will be calculated based on values of "w" and "nf", as "wf=w/nf".
	If you choose the option to calculate the "total_width", parameter "w" will be calculated based on values of "fw" and "nf", as "w=fw*nf".

Version 1.1.0

	DRC script file added.

	Callback function code has been improved a little.

	Error fixes in some of the PCells.
